# Smart Wheelchair IoT Graduation Project

A fusion of hardware, software, and a spark of human-centered design. This project blends Arduino, a voice-controlled system, a Flutter mobile app, and a dedicated website to help individuals with mobility challenges navigate their world with more independence.

---

## Project Overview

The Smart Wheelchair IoT System empowers users to control wheelchair movement using:

* A **Flutter mobile app**
* **Arabic voice commands**
* **Bluetooth communication**, integrated directly with the wheelchair's Arduino-based motor system

The system aims to provide smoother navigation, reduce physical effort, and create a path toward smarter assistive mobility technology.

## Vision & Purpose

This project supports individuals with disabilities by offering:

* Easier movement without relying on physical joystick controls
* Seamless control through an app or voice input
* Digital accessibility aligned with modern smart-city goals
* A future-ready solution that can integrate with GPS, GSM, and traffic-light systems to calculate safer, optimized routes

---

## Components & Tools

### **Hardware**

* Arduino Uno
* Motor driver module
* DC motors
* Bluetooth HC-05 module
* Optional GPS & GSM modules for navigation and medical communication

### **Software**

* **Flutter** (mobile application)
* **Website** (support platform & shopping assistant)
* Arduino C/C++ embedded programming

---

## System Features

### ✅ **Wheelchair Control**

* Move forward, backward, left, right
* Stop command
* Commands triggered using:

  * Arabic voice input
  * On-screen touch arrows

### ✅ **Bluetooth Communication**

* The app sends specific encoded signals to Arduino
* Arduino translates signals into motor actions

### ✅ **GPS & GSM Extensions**

* Location tracking for emergency alerts
* Smart route suggestions

### ✅ **Smart Store Integration (Optional Module)**

Originally developed under the project *Special Needs Shopping Store*, the integrated user-friendly shopping platform offers:

* Product listing with prices and offers
* Dark/light mode customization
* Favorite items
* Smooth checkout process

### Pages From the Shopping Module

* **Homepage**: Displays products, offers, and details
* **User Page**: UI color themes + favorites
* **Purchase Page**: Simple checkout workflow

## System Workflow

1. User opens the Flutter app
2. Chooses either voice or button controls
3. Commands are sent via Bluetooth
4. Arduino receives data and activates motors
5. Optional: Wheelchair sends GPS data via GSM for tracking or route guidance

---

## Highlights

* Built with real-world accessibility needs in mind
* Uses affordable components
* Modular and expandable design
* Supports Arabic speech recognition
* Integrates with smart city systems

## Gallery

(Add the wheelchair prototype images, wiring diagrams, assembly photos.)

---

## Future Improvements

* Obstacle detection using ultrasonic sensors
* Full web dashboard for monitoring
* Cloud backup for emergency cases
* Machine learning to predict movement patterns

---

## Conclusion

This IoT-powered Smart Wheelchair is more than a graduation project. It is a step toward leveling the playing field and giving individuals with mobility challenges the independence and dignity they deserve.
